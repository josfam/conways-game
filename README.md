# Conway's game

An implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for the commandline.

This implementation allows the user to tweak all sorts of properties as they see fit.

This project was also my final project for [Harvard's CS50P, Introduction to Programming with Python course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/),
\
and you can find the [video demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlkMN3I4j80)

## How to adjust game properties

## Picking cell arrangements from a collection of defaults

```sh
python3 conway.py --default hammerhead
```

## Displaying the game in a basic mode, i.e without the pretty display

```sh
python3 conway.py --default hammerhead --basic
```

## Deciding how many iterations of the game are run

```sh
python3 conway.py --default ants -i 10
```

## Deciding how long a pause there is from one iteration to another

```sh
python3 conway.py --default ants -i 5 --pause 1
```

## Providing custom symbols for the cells

```sh
python3 conway.py --default gospers-glider --symbols '~' '^'
```

![ants-iteration-pause-demo](demos/gospers-custom-symbols.gif)

The fact that custom symbols can be set, along with the fact that the cells can be displayed in a `basic` mode, means
that one can produce interesting patterns in the game when they play with unbalanced symbol lengths. e.g.

```sh
python3 conway.py --default buckaroo --symbols '~.~.' '^' --basic --pause 0.2
```

## Controlling (via presets), the color scheme that dead and alive cells have

```sh
python3 conway.py -d gospers-glider --colour black-white -p 0.1
```

![gospers-black-white-demo](demos/gospers-black-white.gif)

Here is the same game, but with the dead and alive colours reversed, i.e.

```sh
python3 conway.py -d gospers-glider --colour white-black -p 0.1
```

## Providing a custom grid, by way of a text file

### Format of cells in the text file

The grid provided is expected to contain only `-` and `*` characters to represent dead and alive
cells respectively.
Providing any other characters (except white-space) in your text file will give you an error that highlights what that invalid character is.
Yes, this also means that you must have one grid per text file

### Acommodation for white-space in the provided text file

Spaces, or tabs within the grid are replaced by dead cells.

Accomodating for these does contribute to error handling and the like, but more importantly
it allows for the user to construct a grid by only providing the placement of alive cells
(rather than being burdened by placing dead cells as well).

Here are the contents of the file `sample-grid.txt` located in the same directory as the script file.
(To see where the spaces are, highlight the contents)

```sh
  
  
  

  
            *   *
             * *
              *
             * *             
              *
             * *
            *   *
  
  
  
  
 
  
```

```sh
python3 conway.py -c grey-orange --filename sample-grid.txt
```

That gives this output:

### Providing a file that does not exist

If a file/file path does not point to a file, a random selection from the pre-defined
grids is shown instead
